# Awesome Agent Skills [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A **small, verified, security-aware** list of Agent Skills (the [SKILL.md](https://agentskills.io/specification) format used by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and more), curated for trust, not a 1,400-skill dump.

A skill is a folder with a SKILL.md that teaches an agent a workflow. The ecosystem exploded, and so did the risk: a skill is code the agent trusts, and Snyk found prompt injection in **36% of tested skills** while Trail of Bits showed the public scanners are bypassable in under an hour. Most lists optimize for count. This one optimizes for signal: the official sources, a tight set of genuinely useful skills, and a first-class security section the volume lists skip.

## Start here: how to think about skills

- **A skill is untrusted code** until you have read its SKILL.md and any scripts. Treat installing one like adding a dependency, or running a stranger's shell script.
- **The trigger description is the security boundary.** The model loads a skill based on its description; a poisoned description is how injection gets in.
- **Scan before you install.** Use a skill scanner (below), and prefer skills from teams you can name.
- **Author for progressive disclosure.** A good skill keeps SKILL.md short and links out to details the agent pulls only when needed.

**The one rule:** volume is not trust. A verified skill from a known team beats a hundred you have not read.
